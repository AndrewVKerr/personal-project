# personal-project
This is my personal project for the year 19-20 in the class CSD

My ultimate goal will be to have an alarm system that is capable of interconnecting multiple devices
such as alarms, sensors, control devices(phones, tablets, computers, etc). I will also need to access
a camera such as a nest door bell or a computer camera and be able to send the images via the web to
a authorized device that requests the feed.

This project will consist of 3 parts;
   1) Networking
        - There will be a need for networking both internal and external.
        - I will most likely need to use HTTP (HTTPS if time permits) and Websockets to get started.
   2) Sensors
        - I will need to have a means to monitor seperate areas such as different rooms.
        - I already have many sensors that I can tap into however I will need to find ways
          to interact with theses existing sensors.
   3) Alarms
        - I will need to find a way to interact with the existing alarms, I believe a simple voltage
          will be enough to activate the existing alarms.
